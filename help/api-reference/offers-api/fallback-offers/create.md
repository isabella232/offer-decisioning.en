# Create a fallback offer

You can create a fallback offer by making a POST request to the [!DNL Offer Library] API, while providing your container ID.

## Accept and Content-Type headers

The following table shows the valid values which comprise the *Content-Type* and *Accept* fields in the request header:

| Header name | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Accept | `application/vnd.adobe.platform.xcore.xdm.receipt+json; version=1` |
| Content-Type | `application/schema-instance+json; version=1;  schema="https://ns.adobe.com/experience/offer-management/fallback-offer;version=0.1"` |

**API format**

```http
POST /{ENDPOINT_PATH}/{CONTAINER_ID}/instances
```

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `{ENDPOINT_PATH}` | The endpoint path for repository APIs. | `https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/xcore/` |
| `{CONTAINER_ID}` | The container where the fallback offers are located. | `e0bd8463-0913-4ca1-bd84-6309134ca1f6` |

```shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/xcore/e0bd8463-0913-4ca1-bd84-6309134ca1f6/instances' \

            }
        ]
}'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns information on the newly created fallback offer, including its unique instance ID and placement `@id`. You can use the instance ID in later steps to update or delete your fallback offer. You can use your unique fallback offer `@id` in a later tutorial to create a decision (previously known as offer activity).
