# Look up a collection

Collections are subsets of offers based on predefined conditions defined by a marketer, such as category of the offer.

You can look up specific collections by making a GET request to the [!DNL Offer Library] API that includes either the collection `@id` or the name of the collection in the request path.

**API format**

```http
GET /{ENDPOINT_PATH}/{CONTAINER_ID}/queries/core/search?schema={SCHEMA_FILTER}&{QUERY_PARAMS}
```

| `{CONTAINER_ID}` | The container where the collections are located. | `e0bd8463-0913-4ca1-bd84-6309134ca1f6` |
| `{SCHEMA_FILTER}` | Defines the schema associated with collections. | `https://ns.adobe.com/experience/offer-management/offer-filter;version=0.1` |
