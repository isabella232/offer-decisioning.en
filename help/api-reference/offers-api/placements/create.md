# Create a placement

You can create a placement by making a POST request to the [!DNL Offer Library] API, while providing your container ID.

## Accept and Content-Type headers

The following table shows the valid values which comprise the *Content-Type* and *Accept* fields in the request header:

| Header name | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Accept | `application/vnd.adobe.platform.xcore.xdm.receipt+json; version=1` |
| Content-Type | `application/schema-instance+json; version=1;  schema="https://ns.adobe.com/experience/offer-management/offer-placement;version=0.4"` |

**API format**

```http
POST /{ENDPOINT_PATH}/{CONTAINER_ID}/instances
```

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `{ENDPOINT_PATH}` | The endpoint path for repository APIs. | `https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/xcore/` |
| `{CONTAINER_ID}` | The container where the placements are located. | `e0bd8463-0913-4ca1-bd84-6309134ca1f6` |

**Request**

```shell
curl -X POST \
  'https://platform.adobe.io/data/core/xcore/e0bd8463-0913-4ca1-bd84-6309134ca1f6/instances' \
  -H 'Accept: application/vnd.adobe.platform.xcore.xdm.receipt+json; version=1' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/schema-instance+json; version=1;  schema="https://ns.adobe.com/experience/offer-management/offer-placement;version=0.4"' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}' \
  -H 'x-api-key: {{API_KEY}}' \
  -H 'x-gw-ims-org-id: {{IMS_ORG}}' \
  -H 'x-sandbox-name: {{SANDBOX_NAME}}'
  -d '{
        "xdm:name": "Sales Placement",
        "xdm:componentType": "https://ns.adobe.com/experience/offer-management/content-component-html",
        "xdm:channel": "https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/channel-types/web",
        "xdm:description": "A test placement to contain offers"
    }'
```

**Response**

A successful response returns the details of the newly created placement, including its unique instance ID and placement `@id`. You can use the instance ID in later steps to update or delete your placement. You can use your unique placement `@id` in later tutorials to create decisions (previously known as offer activity), decision rules, and fallback offers.
