# Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK

[Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/experience-platform/edge/home.html?lang=en#video-overview) is a client-side JavaScript library that allows customers of the Adobe Experience Cloud to interact with the various services in the Experience Cloud through the Adobe Experience Platform Edge Network.

The Adobe Experience Platform Web SDK supports querying the personalization solutions at Adobe, including [!DNL Offer Decisioning], allowing you to retrieve and render personalized offers that you have created using APIs or the Offer Library.
