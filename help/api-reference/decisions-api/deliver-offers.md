# Deliver offers using the Decisions API

[!DNL Offer Decisioning] is a collection of services and UI programs that enables marketers to create and deliver end-user personalized offer experiences, across channels and applications using business logic and decision rules. An offer is a marketing message that may have rules associated with it that specify who is eligible to see the offer.

You can create and deliver offers by making a POST request to the [!DNL Decisions] API.

This tutorial requires a working understanding of APIs, specifically with regards to [!DNL Offer Decisioning]. For more information, see the [[!DNL Offer Decisioning] API developer guide](../getting-started.md). This tutorial also requires that you have a unique placement ID and activity ID value available. If you have not acquired these values, see the tutorials for [creating a placement](../offers-api/placements/create.md) and [creating a decision](../activities-api/activities/create.md).

| `xdm:propositionRequests.xdm:activityId` | The unique activity identifier. | `"xdm:activityId": "xcore:offer-activity:ffed0123"` |
| `xdm:itemCount` | The number of offers to be returned. The maximum number is 30. | `"xdm:itemCount": 2` |
| `xdm:profiles` | This object holds information about the profile for which the decision is requested. For an API request this will contain one profile. |

| `xdm:allowDuplicatePropositions` | This object the control structure of the De-duplication rules. It consists of a series of flags that indicate if the same option can be proposed across a certain dimension. A flag that is set to true means duplicates are allowed and should not be removed across the category indicated by the flag.

| `xdm:mergePolicy.xdm:id` | Identifies the merge policy by which to govern the data returned by profile access service.

| `xdm:responseFormat` | A set of flags that formats the response content. |
| `xdm:responseFormat.xdm:includeContent` | A boolean value that, if set to `true`, includes content to the response. | `"xdm:includeContent": true` |
| `xdm:responseFormat.xdm:includeMetadata` | An object that is used to specify what additional metadata is returned. If this property is not included, then `xdm:id` and `repo:etag` are returned by default. | `name` |
| `xdm:responseFormat.xdm:activity` | This flag identifies the specific metadata information returned for `xdm:activity`. | `name` |
| `xdm:responseFormat.xdm:option` | This flag identifies the specific metadata information returned for `xdm:option`. | `name`, `characteristics`, `priority` |

| `xdm:propositions` | This object contains a single decision activity proposition. Multiple options can be returned for the activity. If no options are found, then the activity's fallback offer is returned. Single decision activity propositions always includes either an `options` property or a `fallback` property. When present, the `options` property cannot be empty. |
| `xdm:propositions.xdm:activity` | This object contains the unique identifier for a decision (previously known as offer activity). | `"xdm:id": "xcore:activity:ffed0123"` |

| `xdm:propositions.xdm:options` | This object contains a single option, including its unique identifier. If present, this object cannot be empty. | `xdm:id": "xcore:personalized-option:ccc0111` |
| `xdm:propositions.xdm:options.@type` | Defines the type of the component. `@type` acts as the processing contract for the client. When the experience is assembled, the composer will look for the component(s) that have a specific type. | `https://ns.adobe.com/experience/offer-management/content-component-imagelink` |
| `xdm:propositions.xdm:content` | The format of the response content. | Response content can be: `text`, `html block`, or `image link` |
| `xdm:score` | The score for an option that is computed as a result of a ranking function associated with the option or the activity. This field will be returned by the API if a ranking function is involved in determining the score of an offer during the ranking. | `"xdm:score": 45.65` |
| `xdm:propositions.xdm:fallback` | This object contains a single fallback offer, including its unique identifier. | `"xdm:id": "xcore:fallback:ccc0222"` |
| `xdm:propositions.xdm:fallback.dc:format` | The physical or digital manifestation of the resource. Typically, format should include the media-type of the resource. The format may be used to determine the software, hardware or other equipment needed to display or operate the resource. It is recommended to select a value from a controlled vocabulary, for example, the list of [Internet Media Types](http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/) defining computer media formats. | `"dc:format": "image/png"` or `"image/jpeg"`|
| `xdm:propositions.xdm:fallback.xdm:deliveryURL` | An optional URL to read the asset from a content delivery network or service endpoint.
