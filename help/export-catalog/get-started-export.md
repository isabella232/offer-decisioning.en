# Get started with offer catalog export {#export-catalog}

Offer Decisioning allows you to automatically export your offer catalog to Adobe Experience Platform.

The export creates one dataset for each object of your Offer Library (see [Access exported datasets](../export-catalog/access-dataset.md)). It includes:

* Personalized offers
* Fallback offers
* Placements
* decisions (previously known as offer activities)

Each time one of these objects is modified in the Offer Library, a new export job is automatically executed to update the datasets.

>[!NOTE]

>This feature is not enabled by default. If you want to use it, reach out to your Adobe contact to have it activated for your catalog. Once it is enabled, export jobs will be automated and will require no action from your side.
