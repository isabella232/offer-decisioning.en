Here is the list of all the fields that can be used in the **[!UICONTROL Decision Object Repository - Placements]** dataset.

<!--A placement describes a location or place in a personalized message. It is used to set technical constraints for content that the personalization decision supplies. The placement also represents a request to produce certain types of metrics when an experience event is produced where this placement is involved. For instance, the placement facilitates a personalized clickable image inside an email shown to an end-user. The placement may for instance request from the assembled experience that the click on its image gets reported in an experience event with a metric https://ns.adobe.com/xdm/data/metrics/web/linkclicks and a reference to this placement.-->
