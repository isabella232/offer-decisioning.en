# Decisions dataset {#decisions-dataset}

Each time an offer is modified, the autogenerated dataset for decisions (formerly known as activities) is updated.

The most recent successful batch in the dataset is displayed on the right. The hierarchical view of the schema for the dataset displays on the left pane.

Here is the list of all the fields that can be used in the **[!UICONTROL Decision Object Repository - Decisions]** dataset (formerly known as Decision Object Repository - Activities).

<!--A decision (formerly known as offer decision) is used to control the decisioning process. It specifies the filter applied to the total inventory to narrow down offers by topic/category, the placement to narrow down the inventory to those offers that technically fit into the reserved space for the offer and specifies a fallback option should the combined constraints disqualify all available personalization offers.-->
    
## Identifier

**Type:** string

**_experience > decisioning > criteria > optionSelection**

**Field:** optionSelection
**Title:** Option Selection
**Description:** The option selection defines the validity/applicability of options in this context.
**Type:** object

* **Description**

    **Field:** description
    **Title:** Description
    **Description:** Option selection description. It is used to convey human readable intentions on how or why this option selection was constructed and/or what option will match.
    **Type:** string

* **Option Filter**

    **Field:** filter
    **Title:** Option Filter
    **Description:** The reference to a tag based filter that matches options from an inventory using their attached tags. The value is the URI (@id) of the decision rule that is referenced. See schema https://ns.adobe.com/experience/decisioning/filter.
    **Type:** string

* **Profile Constraint Type**

    **Field:** optionSelectionType
    **Title:** Profile Constraint Type
    **Description:** Determines if any constraints are currently set and how the contraints are expressed. It could be through a filter query or through one or more segment memberships.
    **Type:** string
    **Possible values:** "none" (default), "directList", "filter"

* **Option List**

    **Field:** options
    **Title:** Option List
    **Description:** A list that directly specifies the options without evaluating a filter query. Either an option list or an option filter rule can be specified.
    **Type:** array

    <!--Missing title under Option List? Desc = An identifier of an decision option entity. The value value refers to an `@id` property of a decision option. Type: string-->

**_experience > decisioning > criteria > placements**

**Field:** placements
**Title:** Placement Restrictions
**Description:** The placement constraint states that this criterion is only applicable for the listed placements. Only when the targeted placement is in the `xdm:placements` list is the option selection considered. Otherwise the entire decision criteria is skipped. When the 'xdm:placements' list is omitted or empty, the criterion is considered for any targeted placement. The placements listed here impose implicit criteria for the option selection. An option to be considered must have a representation for the targeted placement.
**Type:** array

    **Type:** string

**_experience > decisioning > criteria > profileConstraints**

**Field:** profileConstraints
**Title:** Profile Constraint
**Description:** The profile constraint decides if an option selection is eligible for this profile identity at this moment, in this context. If the profile constraint does not need to consider values of each of the option, i.e. it is invariant of the options from the option selection, the profile constraint that evaluates to 'false' cancels out the entire option selection. On the other hand, a profile constraint rule that takes an option as a parameter is evaluated for each qualifiying option of the option selection.
**Type:** object

* **_experience > decisioning > criteria > profileConstraints > Description**

    **Field:** eligibilityRule
    **Title:** Eligibility Rule
    **Description:** A reference to a decision rule that evaluates to true or false for a given profile and/or other given contextual XDM objects. The rule is used to decide if the option qualifies for a given profile. The value is the URI (@id) of the decision rule that is referenced. See schema https://ns.adobe.com/experience/decisioning/rule.
    **Type:** string

* **_experience > decisioning > criteria > profileConstraints > Profile Constraint Type**

    **Field:** profileConstraintType

    * "none" (default)
    * "eligibilityRule": "The profile constraint is expressed as a single rule that must evaluate to true before the constrained action is allowed."

    * "allSegments": "The profile constraint is expressed as one or more segments and the profile must be a member of all of them before the constrained action is allowed."
    * "rules": "The profile constraint is expressed as a number of different rules, e.g. eligibility, applicability, suitability, which all must evaluate to true before the constrained action is allowed."
