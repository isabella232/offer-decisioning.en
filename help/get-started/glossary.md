* **Capping** or **Frequency Capping**: Capping is used as a constraint to define how many times an offer is presented.

* **Collections**: Collections are subsets of offers based on predefined conditions defined by a marketer, such as category of the offer.

* **Decision**: A decision (previously known as offer activity) contains the logic that informs the selection of an offer

* **Decision Rule**: Decision rules are constraints added to a personalized offer and applied to a profile to determine eligibility.
